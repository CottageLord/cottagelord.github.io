                <h2>Motivation</h2><br>

                <p>Window management and switching between multiple application windows is a ubiquitous feature of modern desktop operating systems. 
                    Prior research has established important principles for 2D desktop interfaces and tested various ways of displaying window switching interfaces both on regular screens [1] and large displays [2].</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Current VR systems often mirror traditional 2D desktop displays into virtual space (Figure 1), which can capitalize on users' familiarity with conventional user interfaces (e.g., mobile phone [3]). 
                        Yet, it potentially undermines VR's unique affordances for spatial interface organization [4] and embodied interaction [5]. 
                    </p>

                    <br><h2>Research Question</h2><br>

                    <p>
                        This raises important questions about <b>how established window management principles translate to VR environments and whether novel 3D approaches could enhance user performance</b>.</p>

                    
                    <br><h2>Research Contribution</h2><br>

                    <p>This research aims to explore two key dimensions: First, we seek to validate whether desktop window management findings (e.g., spatial consistency, grid-based layouts, and scaling behaviors) remain applicable in VR contexts where windows exist as floating 2D planes in 3D space.
                        Second, we investigate how VR's unique capabilities for depth perception, peripheral awareness, and volumetric organization can be leveraged to create window management systems that go beyond simple 2D analogues.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>The results will inform the design of future VR workspaces, helping determine whether VR can move beyond simply replicating desktop metaphors to create truly spatial computing environments that enhance productivity through improved window management. 
                        This research addresses the fundamental question of whether VR workspaces can provide compelling advantages over traditional desktop computing for common window management tasks.</p>
