                    <p><b>HCC researcher / Game engine developer / Game designer</b></p>
                    <p>I am a Ph.D. student and research assistant in the <a href="https://computing.clemson.edu/cugame/index.html">CUGAME Lab</a> at Clemson University's School of Computing, where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://guof.people.clemson.edu/">Dr. Guo Freeman</a>.</p>
                    <p>Prior to joining Clemson, I earned my M.S. in Game Science and Design from the <i>Northeastern University</i> (Boston, USA) and B.S. in Computer Science from the <i>University of Arizona</i> (Tucson, USA). My technical background spans multiple areas interactive technology development, including game engine development (e.g., custom 2D and 3D game engines from the ground up), VR systems (e.g., VR applications in Unity), eye tracking (e.g., eyetracking hardware and software on desktop and VR platforms), and digital fabrication (e.g., Arduino, 3D printing, and laser cutting for rapid prototyping).</p>
                    <p>My research mainly focus on how people's digital experience can be mediated and enhanced by various interactive technologies (e.g., live streaming, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality). For example, I am currently investigating these problems:</p>
                    <p><b>(1)</b> How cross-reality systems can solve <b>"VR isolation"</b>, a phenomenon where VR users usually experience a sense of disconnection with the common digital and reality experience. I investigate how to design novel VR interfaces and interactions that seamlessly bridge VR environments with everyday 2D technologies (smartphones, tablets, desktops) and users, allowing people without specialized VR hardware to meaningfully interact and connect with broader users with diverse technologies.</p>
                    <p><b>(2)</b> How VR's spatial computing environment can address 2D screen-based <b>"attention monopolization"</b>, a phenomenon where traditional software competes for limited display space through designs that prioritize exclusive attention capture and prolonged user engagement. I investigate how VR's volumetric display space can diversify software design criteria beyond conventional metrics and facilitate a healthier digital experience.</p>
                    <!-- I investigate how VR's volumetric display space enables application co-presence through various spatial display and interaction paradigms (e.g., center-periphery arrangements, foreground-background layering, active-passive interactions), potentially diversifying software design criteria beyond conventional engagement metrics. Through more nuanced visibility states and hybrid interaction patterns, I explore how spatial computing can enhance users' agency in diversified digital attention allocation and achieve more balanced and free digital experiences.</p> <-->
                    <p><b>(3)</b> How interactive and game-integrated live streaming can address <b>"gaming initiation anxiety"</b>, a phenomenon where players, despite having available time, become hesitant to start games due to the psychological commitment needed to achieve an optimal play state (e.g., entering a "flow"). I explore how streaming platforms can evolve and ultimately blur the traditional boundaries between spectating and playing, creating a new mediated experience that supports high engagement and interaction while requiring less psychological commitment. <!--This opens up new design spaces for both video game and live streaming platforms, including developing games with streaming-optimized visuals, mechanics and narratives, creating collective audience engagement systems that mirror actual gameplay experience, and building cross-platform systems that synchronize streaming activities with in-game progress.</p> <-->
